# Strange Pulse Toolkit

The Strange Pulse Toolkit is a set of Max/MSP tools for working with strange attractors in a compositional context. It treats chaotic systems as active components in musical processes, offering a way to explore non-linear behaviour, feedback, and control.

---

## Features

- A collection of attractor implementations (e.g. Lorenz, Dadras, Thomas), available at control and audio rate
- Tools for scaling, routing and visualising attractor signals
- Trigger generators based on threshold crossings and gradients
- Real-time complexity metrics for feedback (e.g. RPDE, RQA)
- Basic UI components for working with signals and parameters
